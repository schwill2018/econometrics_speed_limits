This repository houses econometric analysis of highway speed limits and accident frequency. The primary purpose of this analysis confirms statistical observations/relations between relaxed speed limits and highway safety. The overall conclusion of this analysis suggests that highway speed limit laws and overall highway safety are not correlated. Data observations were made with STATA. PNG images of each regression of accident data has also been added to support the reader.
